Runners are the foundations of the [Worker](../src/Worker/Worker.php), 
every task is executed via a runner.

## Defining a new runner

Defining a new runner is as simple as it sounds, 
just implement [RunnerInterface](../src/Runner/RunnerInterface.php) and define implementations for each method, 
once this is done, the runner will be tagged and injected in the [Worker](../src/Worker/Worker.php).
